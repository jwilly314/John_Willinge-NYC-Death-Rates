  <h1>NYC Mortality by Borough</h1>

  <h2>Investigation Context</h2>
  <p>In my data journalism project, I wanted to look into death rates in NYC, and more specifically, how mortality rates compare between the city's five boroughs.</p>
  <p>To do this, I used two data sets. The first data set included NYC mortality data by neighbourhood, and the second data set was not available for download as a CSV,</p> 
  <p>but was manually made myself from EpiQuery's NYC Birth and Death data.</p>

  <h2>Data-Cleaning Pipeline</h2>
  <p>1. For my first data set, I removed the columns that contained various region codes that were not relevant for my project. Since my initial data set was very concise, the data was fully cleansed with only one step.</p>
  <p>2. For my second data set, I was able to pick out the data myself from EpiQuery's website, so there was no unneccesary information, and thus no need to cleanse the data.</p>
