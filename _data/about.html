  <h1>NYC Mortality by Borough</h1>

  <h2>Investigation Context</h2>
  <p>In my data journalism project, I wanted to look into death rates in NYC, and more specifically, how mortality rates compare between the city's five boroughs.</p>
  <p>To do this, I used two data sets. The first data set included NYC mortality data by neighbourhood, and the second data set was not available for download as a CSV,</p> 
  <p>but was manually made myself from EpiQuery's NYC Birth and Death data.</p>

  <h2>Data-Cleaning Pipeline</h2>
  <p>1a. For my first data set, I removed all the columns that contained information I did not plan to use. These included the Time Period, GeoType, GeoID, GeoRank, and Number columns.</p>
  <p>1b. I then divided the numbers in the "Age-adjusted rate per 100,000" by 100 in order to turn it into an "Age-adjusted rate per 1000." I then rounded the results to one decimal place. I did this because the information from my other data set was formatted in "Age-adjusted rate per 1000" and rounded to one decimal place, and I wanted to make the data sets match. My reformat_data.py then dumped these remaining two columns into a json using a for loop.</p>
  <p>2. Since there was no CSV available for my second data set, I manually inputted the data from EpiQuery's website into a google sheet. Since I was able to choose what was and was not relevant from the start, there was no unneccesary information, and thus no need to cleanse the data. My reformat_data2.py then dumped the data into a json in a similar manner to reformat_data.py in step one, but I had to modify the code to account for my second data set having many more columns.</p>
