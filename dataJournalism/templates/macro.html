  <h2 style="text-align: center">Interpretations</h2>
  
  <p style="text-align: center">On the map, you can see that the Bronx has the darkest areas on average, followed closely by Staten Island. Queens, on average, has the lighest areas, followed by Manhattan and then Brooklyn. This is indicative of how the five boroughs rank in terms of the death rates, with the Bronx having the highest death rates, followed by Staten Island, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens, in that order. In Brooklyn, Hunts Point - Motthaven has the highest death rates on the map, with an age-adjusted death rate per 1000 of 3.1, followed by East Harlem with 2.9 and Port Richmond with 2.8. On the other hand, Greenwich Village - Soho has the lowest death rates, with an age-adjusted death rate per 1000 of 0.6, followed by Lower Manhattan with 0.7 and the Upper East Side and Bayside - Little Neck tied with 0.8.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: center">Takeaways</h2>
  <p style="text-align: center">1. Firstly, there are clear discrepencies in death rates between the boroughs, even when accounting for age.</p>
  <p style="text-align: center">2. Secondly, there are obvious and significant differences in death rates even between different areas in the same borough.</p>
  <p style="text-align: center">3. Thirdly, and most significantly, these discrepencies in death rates seem to overlap with the discrepencies in economic prosperity between the different boroughs and areas on the map. While I didn't track economic data in this project, it is likely obvious that areas such as SoHo and the Upper East Side, which have some of the lowest death rates on the map, are also some of the wealthiest areas in the city. Likewise, some of the least wealthy areas on the map, such as numerous areas in the Bronx, have some of the highest death rates. This suggests a strong correlation between an area's wealth and it's death rates, which could be indicative of better or worse medical facilities between these richer and poorer areas, or could indicate differences in access to healthcare between wealthy and less wealthy areas.</p>
