    <p>This investigation was made to analyze death rates in NYC by neighborhood and borough over time. The investigation concluded that, although death rates have decreased over time in all areas of NYC, there are still neighborhoods that have disproportionately high death rates in the city; these discrepancies in death rates should be considered in the city's health policies.</p>
